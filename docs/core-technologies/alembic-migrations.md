# Alembic - Database Migration Management

## What is Alembic?

Alembic is a database migration tool that manages changes to your database structure over time. Think of it as version control for your database schema - it keeps track of every change and can apply them in the correct order.

## Role in the Project

Alembic serves as the database evolution manager in our AI Agent Platform. It handles:

- **Schema Versioning**: Tracks which database changes have been applied
- **Migration Generation**: Creates scripts when you modify database models
- **Environment Sync**: Ensures all developers and servers have the same database structure
- **Rollback Support**: Can undo changes if needed

## How It Works

1. **Define Models**: You create Python classes describing database tables
2. **Generate Migrations**: Alembic compares your models to current database and creates migration scripts
3. **Apply Changes**: Migrations run in sequence to update the database
4. **Track Progress**: Alembic remembers which migrations have been applied

## Key Files

- `alembic.ini`: Configuration file with database connection and settings
- `migrations/env.py`: Connection logic and environment setup
- `migrations/versions/`: Directory containing individual migration files

## Benefits

- **Consistent Deployments**: Same database structure across all environments
- **Team Collaboration**: Developers can easily sync database changes
- **Reversible Changes**: Ability to rollback problematic migrations
- **Automated Process**: Integrates with deployment pipelines

## In Our Architecture

Alembic ensures that both Project A (Customer Support) and Project B (Internal Sales) maintain consistent, tenant-aware database schemas across development, staging, and production environments.
